RPress is a lightweight but powerful SSG meta-framework for building static websites using React Server Components.
It is built on top of offical Vite RSC plugin and provides a simple and flexible way to create static websites with React.

Currently, RPress is in early development and is not yet ready for production use.
However, it is already possible to create a simple static website using RPress.
For example, this documentation site is built using RPress itself, and documentation is power by Fumadocs,
which can be use among many framework without too many configuration.

This documentation is also under development btw.
