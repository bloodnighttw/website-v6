# Before you read

It is recommand to read the serious
[GPUI Hello World Tutorial - From Core Concepts to Hello World ](https://blog.0xshadow.dev/posts/learning-gpui/gpui-hello-world-tutorial/)
before reading this article, it provide a basic entry to GPUI since this article is not a beginner tutorial.

This article is part of my studies on GPUI, I will write a series of articles to record my learning process and share my understanding of GPUI.

# What is Entity in GPUI.

A entity is something that is owned and managed by GPUI, and we can access it through app context.

## An Entity that implement Render trait

In GPUI, if a struct implement `Render` trait, and we create it to be managed by GPUI App as `Entity<T>`,
it will be considered as a `View` that is used to render UI elements.

(this code from [GPUI Hello World Tutorial - From Core Concepts to Hello World](https://blog.0xshadow.dev/posts/learning-gpui/gpui-hello-world-tutorial/)):

```rust
// main.rs
use gpui::{
    div, prelude::*, px, rgb, size, App, Application, Bounds, Context, SharedString, Window,
    WindowBounds, WindowOptions,
};

struct HelloWorld {
    text: SharedString,
}

impl Render for HelloWorld {
    fn render(&mut self, _window: &mut Window, _cx: &mut Context<Self>) -> impl IntoElement {
        div()
            .flex()
            .flex_col()
            .bg(rgb(0x2e3440))
            .size(px(500.0))
            .justify_center()
            .items_center()
            .text_xl()
            .text_color(rgb(0xd8dee9))
            .child(format!("Hello, {}!", &self.text))
    }
}

fn main() {
    Application::new().run(|cx: &mut App| {
        let bounds = Bounds::centered(None, size(px(500.), px(500.)), cx);
        cx.open_window(
            WindowOptions {
                window_bounds: Some(WindowBounds::Windowed(bounds)),
                ..Default::default()
            },
            |_, cx| {
                cx.new(|_| HelloWorld {
                    text: "GPUI World".into(),
                })
            },
        )
        .unwrap();
    });
}
```

This is just a basic ui that display "Hello, GPUI World!" in a window. and you can see cx.new create a new `Entity<HelloWorld>`,
and `HelloWorld` implement `Render` trait, so it is a entity can render UI.

## An Entity that does not implement Render trait.

Entity can create without implement `Render` trait, in this case, the entity is not a view that can render UI,
and be consider as just a piece of data that is owned and managed by GPUI App.
