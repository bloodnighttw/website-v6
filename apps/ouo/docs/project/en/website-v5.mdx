This website is developed using TypeScript, React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, and is deployed on Cloudflare.

The purpose of this website is to showcase my portfolio and blog posts.

# Development Process

Before developing this website, I actually built a simple site based on TypeScript, React, and Next.js, and wrote an article about it. However, as development progressed, I found it difficult to make changes and add new features or styles, so I decided to rebuild the site from scratch.

Here are some articles about the development process:

- [[why-i-rewrite-the-blog]] Why I rewrote this website.
- [[mdx-is-arrive]] Why I switched to MDX and the issues I encountered.
- [[markdown-plugin]] How to use remark and rehype plugins to extend Markdown functionality.
